### Understanding Functions

1. How functions look in Java

```
ReturnType Name() {

}

```

2. You could use void for the return type and the function name should be specific & left brace stays on the same line as you define your function.


```
void sendEmail() {

}

```

3. Understanding the MAIN function - the entry point for Java program - the code inside that function gets executed - main should always. Every Java program should have at least 1 function (Main). Main is the entry point to our programs whenever we execute java program and the code inside the main function gets executed. Fucntions do not exist on their own, they should always belong to a class. 

4. A class is a continer for one or more related function. Basically we use these calsses to organize out code. Like sections in a grocery stoer with prodycts. 

5. Every Java program should have at least one class that contains the main function

``` 
class Main {
    void main() {

    }
}
```

6. A method is a function that is part of a class. In some other languages we can have a function that exist outside of class. But when a function belongs to a class we refer to it as a method of that class.
